Kornkreis
=========

A little 3D maze game.

"Kornkreis" is German for crop circle. I was looking for a good name for this new project and had to think of corn fields planted to make a maze.

This is based on notch's (Markus Persson) Ludum Dare game "Prelude of the Chambered". You could call it a modification.
